# Welcome to My Page

  I'm glad you are here. This is only my third project as a developer.  I am learning through th Second Chance Center's Justice-Reskill Program.  I am one of 45 Cohorts involved in the curriculum.  I also use other Computer Coding Bootcamps.  Most offer free Tutorials, and with the user friendly Interface,  it makes learning fun.

## Goals

  * Complete Basic Github/Git Training, Complete Justice-Reskill Class, and I am doing my best to get hired by the end of this Class.
  * Be a Father to My Two little Girls
  * Learn Html/Css, Java/Javascript, Python, Node/Node.js, and probably go on to C+/++
  * Build a Step-by-Step plan for learning the necessary skills to become Hire-Ready
